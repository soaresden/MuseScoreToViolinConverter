# MuseScoreToViolinConverter

As a Noob Violonist player I know where are my fingers supposed to but can't really play the notes when reading it.
Like tabs for Guitar, I tried this method

Regarding Violin : Convert notes into "finger position"
Green color for G string
Red color for D string
Blue color for A string
Brown color for E string

(Colors are chosen regarding Colourstring method, but instead of yellow I choose Brown.
Impossible to see something in yellow !)

Use Librescore to download a mscz file of your choice.
Then open it with the GUI

*Features*

- Read MSCZ, MusicXML files
  
Textbox1 : 
- Read Notes in Textbox 1

Textbox2 :
- Convert these notes into finger position
- 1¹ means upper 1st Finger, upper position, upper frequency
- 3₁ means lower 3rd Finger, lower position, lower frequency

Textbox3 :
If it's your first import : It's equal to Textbox2
Consider this textbox as yours

Edit as you wish
As soon as you edit it, a html file will be created with your own notes
Like that you can type in your own text, select the text and color it with the colors buttons above.

I'm not a Python expert, I used 95% of IA ability to create this.
